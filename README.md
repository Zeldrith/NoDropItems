# NoDropItems

NoDropItems is a plugin designed to allow players to retain some specific items in their inventory upon death while still allowing them to lose other items. This is plugin is intended to help enrich the war experience on the Zeldrith server.

**Beware:** This code was written with assistance from ChatGPT. The codebase and compiler are both a mess. This plugin will either be refactored at some point in the future, or it will be integrated into another plugin and abandoned.
